### AutoML 
This repository focuses on automating the machine learning pipeline using AutoML techniques. AutoML aims to simplify the process of model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, making machine learning more accessible and efficient

### Features
- Frameworks: Utilizes scikit-learn framework for model training and optimization
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Automated search for optimal model parameters
- Implementation: Python scripts for setting up and running the AutoML workflow
